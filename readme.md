- The Mom Test
  - Talk about their life, not your idea.
  - Talk specifics, not hypotheticals
  - Listen, don't talk
- 5 great questions you can ask in every user interview
  - What's the hardest part about [doing this thing]?
  - Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem...
    - in details, when where why how
    - reference back to real life example and to see if your solution can solve this specific event
  - Why was that hard?
    - understand how to market the product, **customer don't buy what, they buy why.**
  - What, if anyting, have you done to try to solve the problem?
  - What's don't you love about the solutions you've tried?
- Talking to users is useful at all stages:
  - Idea stage -> find user with the problem
    - yourself, friends, coworkers, intros
    - dropy by in person, just show up, zoom interview
    - industry events
    - tips
      - take notes, or bring someone to take notes
      - keep it casual
      - careful with their time
  - Prototype stage -> identify best first customer
    - find numerical answers to:
      - *how much* does this problem cost them(user's ROI, portenial savings to user)
      - how frequent is the problem (daily, monthly, quarterly?)
      - ability to fix: how large is their budget($ and authority)
  - Launched -> find product market fit

    - tips
      - ask for phone number when signup
      - don't design by committee(have a way to verify, e.g. premium paywall, ask for credit card, or ask for signup for new feature)

### How to Plan an MVP - Michal Seibel
- [course](https://www.startupschool.org/videos/65), [slide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fcrsi502e54i8eb/Michael%20Seibel%20-%20How%20to%20Plan%20an%20MVP.pdf?dl=0)
- Talk to your users before writing code
  - not 3 yrs research
  - some versation helps, it will be awesome if you are own user
- Goal of pre-launch startup:
  - LAUNCH SOMETHING BAD QUICKLY!
  - Get Initial users, just get anyone use the product!
  - Talk to your users and get feedback
  - Iterate (improve the product)
- Lean MVP
  - VERY FAST to build (weeks not months)
  - very limited functionality
  - appeal to a small set of users
  - A base to iterate from
- Example 1: Aribnb MVP
  - No payments, no map view, part-time CTO
- Example 2: Twitch
  - Only video and chat, only 1 channel, low res video, no video games
- Example 3: stripe(/dev/payments)
  - no bank deals, few features, founder would come to your office and setup up for you
- some cases: Heavy MVP
  - industry with significant regulation(insurance, banking)
  - hardtech - rocket
  - biotech
  - moonshot(dig tunnels?)
  - your MVP can still be just a simple website, explain what you want to do
- launching
  - there is no special launch moment, nobody remember when twitter/google/fb launched
  - launch = start getting customers!
  - the idea is learning from customers is easier with an MVP than without, that's all.
- heacks for building an MVP quickly
    - timebox it
    - write your spec!(otherwise it's so easy to change without noticing it, you need to write it down, so you know what you change)
    - cut your spec! make sure you launch and roll out something, otherwise, it's so easy to change
    - don't fall love with your MVP/idea
- Q/A
  - Q: I talked user but their feedback kinda even out
    - A: never ask user for features, ask for "Problems"! There must be an overlay with problem!
      - what's the problem
      - how much you will pay
      - do anyone else have that problem
      - how often
      - even user talk some features from other products, keep digging into the issue and scope the problem
  - Q: Stuck in the cycle of changing and not launching
    - A: sometime, just don't think it's less special, just not change
      - you want to find out a shirt and paint and throw it away, you don't want to keep editting or playing with one
